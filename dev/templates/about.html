        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p class="white-text">Muir Woods strives to provide a positive experience and quality product. We carry fair trade coffee from an award winning local roaster, organic loose leaf teas, and a selection of pastries from a local bakery.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <span>We work to embody individuals from all backgrounds, interests, and places in life and create the opportunity to make unexpected connections and friendships.<br/><br/></span> We are a space run by students for other students and we hope to foster a sense of community that is unparalleled on this campus.</p>

    <div id="history">
        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p class="white-text">Four score and 7 years ago on a dark and stormy night eighteen men and women were huddled in a small, moist, dark room looking for answers. The very room in question is the space we now call our supply closet.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <span>It was on this night that a bright idea was born, an idea so revolutionary that it has continued to grow daily since its inception.<br/><br/></span> Although many thought this task seemed far too daunting and was seemingly impossible, we have risen against all odds and remained a strong force on campus. Many enemies continue to sabotage our establishment, but we have continued to remain victorious. Come join us in our valiant fight.</p>
