I am an awkward individual, but absolutely loe having conversations and am more than happy to answer any coffee related questions, give any suggestions on fun coffee shops to explore, or even ponder the meaning of life with you. But I must warn you I am sarcastic about 95% of the time and love to joke around so please don't take me too seriously.Sarah	Co-Manager	img/muiristas/sarah.jpg	Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Weird fun facts about me are that I subconsciously shake my hips.dance in my seat when I am eating because it is when I am happiest and I have been known to touch my nose instead of my chin when I am thinking or studying. I can never study in my own apartment, so I like studying at coffee shops with a vanilla latte in hand and I am always in the mood for a good pun. Stop by and say hi!
